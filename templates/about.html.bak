<div id="leftcolumn"> <b>Sentiment Analysis:</b> A term that refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, 
and computational linguistics in order to ascertain the attitude of a speaker or writer toward a specific topic. Basically, 
it helps to determine whether a text is expressing sentiments that are positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis 
is an excellent way to discover how people, particularly consumers, feel about a particular topic, product, or idea. 
The origin of sentiment analysis can be traced to the 1950s, when sentiment analysis was primarily used on written paper documents. 
Today, however, sentiment analysis is widely used to mine subjective information from content on the Internet, including texts, 
tweets, blogs, social media, news articles, reviews, and comments. This is done using a variety of different techniques, 
including NLP, statistics, and machine learning methods. Organizations then use the information mined to identify new 
opportunities and better target their message toward their target demographics. </div>

<div id="content"> This project is a web application for e-commerce to assist consumers in learning
more about games and determining whether it is the appropriate fit for them. We use a 
database of sentiment-based keywords along with positivity or negativity weight in database and 
then based on these sentiment keywords mined in  user comment is ranked. We think that 
numerous perspectives are better than one, and that opinions must be scored. 
There are other Sentiment Analysis applications. However what makes this application unique is the integration 
with an original dictionary of weighted words that are used in the gamming environment, adding specific terms to calculate the scoring gives as a 
result a most accurate sentiment analysis. </div>
